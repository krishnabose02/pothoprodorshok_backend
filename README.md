If you think Indian roads are unsafe for you, you have come to the right place.
We also think the same. Indian roads are unsafe. Go back to your own fucking country.

## Running Locally

We do agree our lives are so fucked up these days. Most of us work sitting in a place and don't even move a bit. Wake up, brush, shit, office, type, coffee, type some more, dinner, sleep.

Well a little suggestion. if not gym, at least TRY RUNNING LOCALLY.

First things first. Get good jogging shoes. (Remember you're overweight now like the node_modules folder)

And Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) installed.

```sh
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/jobless_coders/bengalathon/pothoprodorshok_backend.git
$ cd pothoprodorshok_backend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).

But you're still sitting with your fat ass sticking to that chair. Shame.

The code has two branches. The master is for tinkering with, and heroku is a little sensitive one. If you push to heroku, it goes and messes with the live heroku server. So make sure you know what you're doing.
